== Introduction

Keep-balance is used for maintaining a balance within a set of keepstore servers. It creates new copies of underreplicated blocks, and deletes excess copies of overreplicated and unreferenced blocks. (see `keep-balance -h`)

== Installation and Configuration

[Note]
====
Keep-balance is a https client. It expects that the connection to the API Server is over HTTPS, and if not, it complains. At this 
====

Install according to http://doc.arvados.org/install/install-keep-balance.html[the instructions on the wiki] for now. The instructions also go through configuring the system.

== Notes
1. Keep-balance does not replicate data across the volumes of an individual server, but it does replicate the data across different servers (confirm this)
